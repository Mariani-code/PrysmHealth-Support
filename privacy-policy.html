            <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>

            <h2>5. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

                <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, court order, or government regulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If Prysm is acquired or merged with another company, your data may be transferred, but the new entity must honor this Privacy Policy.</li>
